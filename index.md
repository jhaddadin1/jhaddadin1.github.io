## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1 

    Lab 1 was a favorite of mine because It was an introduction to the class of CPSC 120. This lab helped me understand Github more and the different commands to use for coding, It was basically my first ever code to do and when It passed the tests, it made me feel good that I did it correctly.

* Lab 5 

    Lab 5, part 1 was a favorite of mine. It was a challenge to do this lab because we had to find the length and width of a rectangle and It took me quite some time to figure this out. Because of this lab, I became more comfortable with coding.

* Lab 12 
    
    Lab 12, part 2 was a favorite of mine as well. Putting our knowledge together to work with images, conditions, functions and loops to create an image is what we did in Lab 12. This lab was pretty tough but also benefited us a lot because of the challenge and helping us to be more advanced.
