## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1 was a favorite of mine. It was an introduction to the class. It helped shape what we know right now in programming and made me comfortable with using Github.

* Lab 5, part 1 was a favorite of mine. It talked about calculating the area of a rectangle, which taught me how to do so when programming. It was also quite challenging because It used multiple files, which is why this was chosen as a favorite.

* Lab 12, part 2 was a favorite of mine as well. Putting our knowledge together to work with images, conditions, functions and loops to create an image is what we did in Lab 12. This lab was pretty tough but also benefited us a lot because of the challenge and helping us to be more advanced.
